      Asmara, or Asmera, is the capital and most populous city of Eritrea, in
      the country's Central Region. It sits at an elevation of 2,325 metres,
      making it the sixth highest capital in the world by altitude and the
      second highest capital in Africa. The city is located at the tip of an
      escarpment that is both the northwestern edge of the Eritrean Highlands
      and the Great Rift Valley in neighbouring Ethiopia. In 2017, the city was
      declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its well-preserved modernist
      architecture. The site of Asmera was first settled in 800 BC with a
      population ranging from 100 to 1,000. The city was then founded in the
      12th century AD after four separate villages unified to live together
      peacefully after long periods of conflict.[5] Under Italian rule the city
      of Asmara was made capital of Eritrea in the last years of the 19th
      century. Since this is the city that I grew up in, there are a lot of
      places to hang out and have a good time with friends and family. cafes',
      pubs, parks, gardens and Cinemas. Now we will look at some of the famous
      Cinemas in Asmara.
